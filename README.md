# Time_Series_Model_Comparation_and_Evaluation

This report is aiming to use data in M3-competetion to explore various models and use them 
to generate forecasts as well as evaluate the forecasts through different measures and aspects. 
It firstly explores different models in the families of regression, exponential smoothing and 
ARIMA models to find the most suitable models from each family for a certain time series. 
Among these three methods, ARIMA model turns out to have a more decent performance
than other two after comparing and evaluating these three models. The evaluation of the 18-
month forecasts that have been generated from these models also shows a comprehensive 
advantage of the ARIMA model.

Then, in the batch forecast, the MAPA models is identified as the best model for the overall
130 time series. The equally weighted combination strategy is also proven to be effective on 
improving or at least stabilizing the accuracy. The selection strategy also has a relatively
good performance, however, it takes more time than other methods. The evaluation and 
analysis indicate that the forecast horizon and data category have significant effects on the 
accuracy. In this process, the MAPA, equal weights combination and self-defined methods 
are turned out to be the best three models.
